# PrimeTables

--------------------------------------------------
## Running:

The application is run using:

> node primetable.js

You will then be prompted for a whole number which will determine the size of prime multiple table that will be displayed. You will continue to be asked for further whole numbers until you type

> quit

and the application will end. Tests are run with the command

> npm test

--------------------------------------------------
## What I'm pleased with:

I'm pleased with my prime set generators. I wasn't initially with my sieve method as it was much slower than the brute force method but after improving it the method was much more efficient, both in terms of memory and time. I was quite happy with my approach to the testing and attempting to keep my methods small and concise. I hope to gain more experience in both of these however as this was my first attempt at doing so.

--------------------------------------------------
## What I'd do with more time:

I would like to improve upon the user interface. The input of the number and quitting the application could be more presentable and user-friendly. The output to console makes any attempt at displaying large arrays difficult to read. I would like to learn how I could create a simple web page to handle both these problems.
